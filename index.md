## EmailBot

A discord bot to send Emails so you never have to open an Email Client. 

Great for newsletters on a discord server

Works on multiple servers at the same time (Public bot coming soon!!!)

### Copy this Repo and try it out


```markdown
Commands:

All argument seperated by '; '

!help: posts the helpembed
!mailinglist: <EmailAdress>: Add one Email Adress to mailing list.
!email; <Title(Subject)>; <Description(Text)>: Sends an Email to the Email list Cannot use if you cant (@everyone or @here)
```
To use now make your own installation of the bot multi server functionality still WIP.
